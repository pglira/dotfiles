# dotfiles

Just my dotfiles. Feel free to use them.

- **Operating system**: Mostly Ubuntu
- **WM**: i3 (with i3blocks)
- **Shell**: bash
- **Terminal**: alacritty (with tmux)
- **Editor**: vim
- **File manager**: vifm
- **IDE**: clion in vim mode
- **Video player**: mpv
- **Music player**: moc
- **Image viewer**: sxiv
- **PDF viewer**: okular

Programs I don't use anymore are moved to ``.archive``.

I use the shell scripts ``install-all-dots.sh`` and ``install-program-dots.sh`` to install my dotfiles across various PCs.

Works on my machine ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
